# SCT_DS_Task2
 Titanic Survival Data Analysis &amp; Visualization
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to explore passenger survival patterns.
It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visual exploration using Python.

📊 Key Highlights:
Handled missing values for Age and Embarked, and transformed Cabin into binary (Yes/No).

Converted categorical variables to appropriate data types.

Visualized survival distribution overall and by key factors:

Gender

Passenger Class

Age

Generated a heatmap of feature correlations.

📈 Visualizations Include:
✅ Survival counts
✅ Survival by gender and class
✅ Age distribution of survivors and non-survivors
✅ Correlation heatmap of numeric features

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

This project is a good example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world data.
